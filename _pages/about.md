I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes physics simulation, computer graphics and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tao Du](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~taodu/) from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University.
